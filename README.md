# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Introduction  
The goal of this project is to generate a path for a self driving car to drive in a simulated three lane highway scenario. In the highway, there will be other cars driving and the goal is to drive as fast and safely as possible. (ie: switch lane when the car in front 
While generating the path, there are a few rules (obvious but important) that the self driving car must follow.  
1) The car must not exceed 50 MPH speed limit.
2) The car must not experience an acceleration over 10m/s^2 in any direction.
3) The car must not experience a jerk greater than 50m/s^2.
4) The car must not make unsafe lane changes.
5) The car must stay within the lane

### Implementation steps

#### Road Trajectory generation
The track waypoints were given as a csv file where each waypoint is roughly 30 meters apart. With the given waypoint, the goal is to create a smooth trajectory for the car to follow. In order to achieve that, we apply the a spline function to the waypoints in which spline will go through all the points in the trajctory. In order to maintain a smooth transition between the trajectory at each time step, the last 2 points of the previous trajectory will be included as the first two point in the next trajectory. This way, there will not be a disconnect between the 2 trajectory at two different time step. 

#### Speed Control
One of the rules for the self driving car is to not exceed the 50 MPH. In this case, the max reference speed for the car is set at 49.5 MPH. When there are no other cars in front of the car, then the car will go at the max speed. Then, once the car detected a car in front of it, the car will slow down and start planning to see if it can switch lanes.

#### Lane switch
Using the sensor data, we have information of how close the other cars are at. The logic is simple here, if there is a car in front of us and the car is going too slow, slow down and try to switch lane. When we determined that there are no cars within hitting distance to the left or to the right, the car will switch lanes accordingly. In the case where both left and right are clear, I decided to have the car switch to the left. This is because normally when passing a car in the freeway, we will want to use the most inner lane, since the outer lanes tends to have slower cars (cars trying to take the exit, etc). Once we make the decision on which lane to switch to, we will generate the next spline by placing the last few points in the new lanes, this way, there will be a smooth lane change. 

#### Reflection
This is a really fun and interesting project! Path planning is one of the most difficult and important step in getting a self driving car to work efficiently. Given sensor data, we are able to determine when it is safe to switch lane. We need to think of different situations and scenarios that the car can potentially experience in order to generate a safe trajectory. This had me thinking: can machine learning be applied in this area? Can a simple camera and end-to-end learning be enough to get a safe trajectory? There are so many potential in this area and this is extremely.

Some improvement that I want to make to this project is adding more states and conditions for the car. For instance, it is possible to have the car accelerate while switching lane, and in this case, the gap require to switch lane can potentially decrease. Also, the car switch lanes for just to pass the slow car and switch back to the original lane. 

## Original Info from Udacity
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
